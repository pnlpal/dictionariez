# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Storage

### Free Version
By default, Dictionariez/Ordböcker/SidePal does not collect any browser information or personal user data. Your lookup history and settings are stored locally in your browser's storage and synced using the browser's built-in sync service.

**TTS & Translation Trials**: Free users can trial our Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Translation services with limited usage. When using these features, the selected text is temporarily sent to our servers to generate speech audio or translations.

### Pro Version
If you subscribe to PNL Pro, we collect and store the following data to provide cloud synchronization and premium services:

- **Lookup History**: Words you've looked up and their associated data
- **User Preferences**: Some of your settings and dictionary configurations
- **Account Information**: Basic account details necessary for authentication and service provision
- **TTS & Translation Usage**: Text content sent for speech synthesis and translation (processed in real-time, not permanently stored)

This data is stored securely on our cloud servers to enable synchronization across your devices.

## Third-Party Services

This extension integrates with various dictionary websites and services. These third-party services may use cookies or web storage according to their own privacy policies. Dictionariez/Ordböcker/SidePal does not modify or control third-party behavior. Your interactions with these services are governed by their respective privacy policies, just as if you visited their websites directly.

Our TTS and Translation services may utilize third-party speech synthesis and translation providers, which process text according to their own privacy policies.

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data during transmission and storage. Your Pro account data is encrypted and stored securely on our servers. TTS and translation text processing is conducted over secure connections and text content is not retained after processing.
