# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Storage

### Free Version
By default, Dictionariez/Ordböcker/SidePal does not collect any browser information or personal user data. Your lookup history and settings are stored locally in your browser's storage and synced using the browser's built-in sync service.

**AI Services Trials (TTS, Translation, AI Lookup)**: Free users can trial our Text-to-Speech (TTS), Translation, and AI Lookup services with limited usage. When using these features, the selected text is temporarily sent to our servers to generate speech audio, translations, or AI definitions.

### Pro Version
If you subscribe to PNL Pro, we collect and store the following data to provide cloud synchronization and premium services:

- **Lookup History**: Words you've looked up and their associated data
- **User Preferences**: Some of your settings and dictionary configurations
- **Account Information**: Basic account details necessary for authentication and service provision
- **AI Services Usage**: Text content sent for speech synthesis, translation, and AI lookup (processed in real-time, not permanently stored)

This data is stored securely on our cloud servers to enable synchronization across your devices.
