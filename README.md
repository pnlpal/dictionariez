Welcome to Dictionariez, the language learning extension available on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, designed to enhance your language learning experience.

With Dictionariez, you can simply double-click on any word to access its definition, which appears on the screen, making it the fastest way to look up words.

Dictionariez offers a wide range of languages support, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Russian, and Tajik. If you need support for additional languages, you can request it on our [Programming and Language community].

Another way is to just click on the app's icon to access a popup window with various dictionaries to search through. This feature allows you to explore words in more depth, with additional features such as auto-completion, word history, keyboard shortcuts, and real human pronunciation to enhance your learning experience.

As a language learner myself, I understand the challenges of learning a new language. That's why my goal is to provide a universal tool that enables users to look up any word in any language. We need your feedback and suggestions to improve the app experience.

Join the [Programming and Language community] today! You can also join our [Discord channel] to discuss linguistics, programming, and even participate in virtual language corners. Together, we can build a community that facilitates language learning.

We look forward to hearing from you and helping you achieve your language learning goals with Dictionariez.

# Donate

I used to be a freelancer, and have been employed for several years. But now I am jobless. This project started as a sideline for fun, now I want to see how far it could go. If you find it's useful, please consider to donate, a cup of coffee would be my greatest incentive.  
Thank you.
