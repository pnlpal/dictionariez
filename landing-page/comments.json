It seems that the majority of words I need to define are not available through the previous dictionary extension, so it became more of a nuisance than a convenience. Your extension appears to do exactly what such an extension is supposed to do. And, with the added features, a great deal more. I would give you 10/5 stars if possible. Thank you again!"

I finally have the perfect dictionary extension that I've been wanting. Edge/Chrome keep removing useful features like the 'Define' from the context menu. AI options are slow and inaccurate. This extension is quick and has a bevy of options for customizability. If I could afford to chip in, I would. It's really that much better than Google dictionary extension, which doesn't work on half the words you want it to."

This one fills the void I had from Safari's right click word look up function, but far more featured and customizable, if you so desire. Thanks River! I hope Mozilla starts actively monitoring so trustworthy security vouching brings you a greater audience."
